"They Told Stories" is an immersive original narrative experience developed using TouchDesigner, Arduino, Max/MSP and various other media tools. The piece focuses on utilizing real time media creation and responsivity to envelope the audience in a fully developed visual and audio story-space. This piece was created from my interest of infiltrating the space of technology in enchanting environments, specifically with the catalyst of storytelling.
